Please write a program which asks for two integer numbers.
The program should then print out whichever is greater.
If the numbers are equal, the program should print a different message.

Please type in the first number: 5
Please type in another number: 3
The greater number was: 5

Please type in the first number: 5
Please type in another number: 8
The greater number was: 8

Please type in the first number: 5
Please type in another number: 5
The numbers are equal!
