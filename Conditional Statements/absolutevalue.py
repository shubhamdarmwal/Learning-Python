Please write a program which asks the user for an integer number. If the number is less than zero, the program should print out the number multiplied by -1.
Otherwise the program prints out the number as is. Please have a look at the examples of expected behaviour below.

Please type in a number: -7
The absolute value of this number is 7

Please type in a number: 1
The absolute value of this number is 1

Please type in a number: -99
The absolute value of this number is 99
