#A program which prints out different things based on whether the number the user inputs is negative, positive, or equal to zero:

number = int(input("Please type in a number: "))

if number < 0:
    print("The number is negative.")

if number > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")

if number == 0:
  print("The number is zero.")
